# OWASP-Top-10-2021


## Overview
This repository contains solutions, insights, and screenshots for the OWASP Top 10 module on TryHackMe, completed by **Daniel Mwendwa Mwithui**. The exercises cover the most critical web application security risks, including mitigation strategies to enhance secure coding practices.

## OWASP Top 10 Risks (2021)
1. **Broken Access Control**  
   Mitigation: Implement robust authentication and session management mechanisms.
   
2. **Cryptographic Failures**  
   Mitigation: Follow best practices in cryptographic protocols and algorithms.
   
3. **Injection**  
   Mitigation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
   
4. **Insecure Design**  
   Mitigation: Incorporate security into system design from the ground up.
   
5. **Security Misconfiguration**  
   Mitigation: Regular audits and secure configuration management.
   
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**  
   Mitigation: Keep all components updated and monitor for vulnerabilities.
   
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**  
   Mitigation: Use strong passwords, enforce MFA, and secure password storage.
   
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**  
   Mitigation: Implement integrity checks and strong encryption mechanisms.
   
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**  
   Mitigation: Establish robust logging and monitoring mechanisms.
   
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**  
    Mitigation: Validate and sanitize user-supplied inputs for external requests.
